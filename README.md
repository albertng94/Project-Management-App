Project to create a simple Project Management App (from the "React - The Complete Guide 2024 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" course from Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller in Udemy).

**About the project:** This project corresponds to section 9 of the mentioned course and was performed completely autonomously by me based on Maximilian's final result's pictures taken from the video lessons.Thus, the result is almost completely identical style-wise, but not so the code.

**Built with:**
- HTML
- CSS
- Tailwind
- JavaScript
- React

**Accomplishments:**
- Improved general React and JavaScript knowledge.
- Learned to use the "useRef" hook in order to track the current value of an html interactive element (such as an input) and use it internally without having to update the state.
- Learned to use the "forwardRef" method to take a ref from one component and use it in a different one.
- Got familiar with the use of "Tailwind" as a CSS framework for React projects.
- Learned that a prop can be used to link the execution of a function in component A, causing the execution of another function in component B.
